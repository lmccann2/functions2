#Percentages(3-5)

#Create an application whose main function
#holds two float values input by a user, stored as variables.
#Pass both variables to a function named computePercent that displays
#the two values and the value of the first number as a percentage of
#the second one. For example, if the numbers are 2.0 and 5.0,
#the function should display a statement similar to "2.0 is 40.0 percent
#of 5.0." Then, call the function a second time, passing the values in
#reverse order.

#Sample run:

#Enter a float: 2.0
#Enter another float: 5.0
#2.0 is 40.0 percent of 5.0
#5.0 is 250.0 percent of 2.0

def main():
    num1 = float(input("Please enter a float: "))
    num2 = float(input("Please enter another float: "))
#CALL computePercent function
    computePercent(num1, num2)

    
#function def computePercent(num1, num2):
def computePercent(num1, num2):
    computePercent = 100 / num2 * num1
    print(f"{num1:.2f} is: {computePercent:.2f}%. of {num2:.2f}.")
#reverse the output order and percentages
    computePercent = 100 / num1 * num2
    print(f"{num2:.2f} is: {computePercent:.2f}%. of {num1:.2f}.")
#    return computePercent does not return in Program
#Call the main
main()
